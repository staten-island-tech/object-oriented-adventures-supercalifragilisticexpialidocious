### In the year 5000 CE, a man of the 21st century no-clipped through a blue swirly thingy into an abandoned futuristic world. A nymph's pneuma tells him that the big whale entangled the timelines and left no choice but to kill it. THE BIG WHALE'S NAME IS WHALEN. The pneuma is lazy and mad unhelpful, so she left him to his own devices to fight bounties and gain a currency called "glowstones" from glowstones, he can purchase upgrades and power himself up through realms to prepare his battle with Whalen. There are 5 realms, Tundra, Vertical Forest, Springfield, Jungle City (can buy underwater gear), and Atlantis (Whalen bossfight). Tundra requires level 0. Vertical Forest: 7, Springfield: 15, Jungle City: 23, Atlantis: Atlantis: 35. After beating Whalen, you get the WHALEN GEAR AND WEAPONS AND BADGES. However, you realize after killing Whalen that you can never go back. SO YOU START A NEW LIFE HERE. The game does not end, and you unlock all the realms, and you can still gain badges if you want and progress in the game.
